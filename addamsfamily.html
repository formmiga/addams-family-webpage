        <b>The Addams Family</b> is a fictional family created by American
        cartoonist Charles Addams. They originally appeared in a series of 150
        unrelated single-panel comics, about half of which were originally
        published in The New Yorker between 1938 and their creator's death in
        1988. They have since been adapted to other media, such as television,
        film, video games, comic books, a musical, and merchandise.

      <p>
        The Addamses are a satirical inversion of the ideal postwar American
        middle-class nuclear family: an odd old money clan who delight in the
        macabre and are seemingly unaware or unconcerned that other people find
        them bizarre or frightening. The family members were unnamed until the
        1964 television series. The Addams Family consists of Gomez and Morticia
        Addams, their children, Wednesday and Pugsley, and close family members,
        Uncle Fester[a] and Grandmama,[b] their butler Lurch, and Pugsley's pet
        octopus, Aristotle. The dimly seen Thing (later a disembodied hand) was
        introduced in 1954, and Gomez's Cousin Itt, Morticia's pet lion Kitty
        Kat and Morticia’s carnivorous plant Cleopatra in 1964. Pubert Addams,
        Wednesday and Pugsley's infant brother, was introduced in the 1993 film
        Addams Family Values.[c]

        <h2>History</h2>

        <h3>Original The New Yorker cartoons (1938–1964)</h3>
        <p>
          Charles Addams began as a cartoonist in The New Yorker with a sketch
          of a window washer that ran on February 6, 1932.[2] The first Addams
          Family cartoon was published in 1938, in a one-panel gag format.
          Charles Addams became a regular contributor to The New Yorker, and
          drew approximately 1,300 cartoons between then and his death in 1988.
          58 of these would feature the Addams Family, almost all of which were
          published in the 1940s and 1950s.[3]

        <h2>Premise and background</h2>

        <p>
          The family appears to be a branch of an extensive Addams clan with
          relatives all over the world. In the original television series they
          are said to be related to "those one-D Adamses", a fact the family are
          deeply ashamed of. According to the film version, the family credo is,
          Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc (pseudo-Latin: "We gladly feast
          on those who would subdue us"). Charles Addams was first inspired by
          his hometown of Westfield, New Jersey, an area full of ornate
          Victorian mansions and archaic graveyards.[6] In the original comics
          series they live in a gothic house on Cemetery Ridge. According to the
          television series, the residence is a gloomy mansion adjacent to a
          cemetery and a swamp located in an unspecified American town. In the
          musical (first shown in Chicago in 2009), the house is located in
          Central Park.[7] In the 2019 film, the Addamses live in an abandoned
          asylum located in the outskirts of the state of New Jersey which is
          haunted by a disembodied resident who demands the property to remain
          undisturbed.
